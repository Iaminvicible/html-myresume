<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Samson but people call me Onyebuchi. I am a graduate of OAU with a credit in physiotherapy. I am Nigerian by nationality and and an Igbo guy. Funny enough both my parents are from the same state and town but different villages. I speak 3 languagues (English, Igbo and Yoruba). I am learning hausa presently to become a complete Nigerian (funny right). I happened to be the first born of my home which places lots of responsibilities on my shoulder.</p>

<p>I am single and searching for the bone of my bone. I have been in some relationship in the past and it has helped me discover a part of me I never knew prior to each of those relationship. I believe in true love and also in the possibilities for growth in the relationship. 
  I am hoping that in the near future I would meet the right one for an imperfect being like myself who would teach me even more things than I already know.</p>

<p>I have lots of interesting fun activities which include playing video games, watching football, going on vacation, going to the gym, watching anime and some interesting series, going for festivals and lots more. I am quite a simple guy although I often don't give an opportunity to  be disrespected or insulted. I hate lies and deceit and often detach from people who do such.</p>

<p>I am aiming to be the first billionaire in my lineage but not just that to be able to touch people's life positively. I am looking forward to opening a hospital that can provide affordable quality health care services especially to people in need. I would liase and connect with importannt personnele to make this happen. I also intend to travel to varioys toursit centers around the world enjoying nature and God's beautiful creation.</p>
